#: Desktop Files - Bygfoot is a football (a.k.a. soccer) management game for PC-BSD and other UNIX look-alikes. It is an original concept by Gyz Both and has been improved with suggestions by players from all over the world. After Gyz abandoned the project, Mark Lawrenz took over and is currently developing and maintaining Bygfoot.  Bygfoot allows you to manage a team by training the players, buying and selling them, contracting loans, maintaining the stadium, etc. You can be promoted or relegated, even become a champion if you're a skillful manager.  The game is deliberately kept simple (though not easy): you only have to keep one eye at your players and another at your stadium.

Fabrice developed a Glide front-end, one of the first hardware-accelerated renderers. Hurdler was originally introduced to develop GL support, however as time went by, Hurdler increasingly maintained the project. Pate took on the task of creating a new OpenGL renderer, as Hurdler had less time to contribute to the project after pursuing a career in professional game development.

Fabrice developed a Glide front-end, one of the first hardware-accelerated renderers. Hurdler was originally introduced to develop GL support, however as time went by, Hurdler increasingly maintained the project. Pate took on the task of creating a new OpenGL renderer, as Hurdler had less time to contribute to the project after pursuing a career in professional game development.

When playing Liquid War, one has to eat one's opponent. There can be from 2 to 6 players. There are no weapons, the only thing you have to do is to move a cursor in a 2-D battlefield. This cursor is followed by your army, which is composed by a great many little fighters. Fighters are represented by small colored squares. All the fighters who have the same color belong to the same team. One very often controls several thousands fighters at the same time. And when fighters from different teams meet, they eat each other, it is as simple as that.  Note: If the game crashes this might resolve it:     Inside liquidwar, go to options->rules->advanced and change     Algorithm from "Assembly" to "Standard C" See also the "ASM" option in the port build options.

The designated builders must ensure there are spawn structures or other players will not be able to rejoin the game after death. Other structures provide automated base defense (to some degree), healing functions and much more...  Player advancement is different depending on which team you are on. As a human, players are rewarded with credits for each alien kill. These credits may be used to purchase new weapons and upgrades from the "Armoury". The alien team advances quite differently. Upon killing a human foe, the alien is able to evolve into a new class. The more kills gained the more powerful the classes available.  The overall objective behind Tremulous is to eliminate the opposing team. This is achieved by not only killing the opposing players but also removing their ability to respawn by destroying their spawn structures.

To add to the excitement, chunks of red garbage will fall from above. It is impossible to eliminate this garbage directly. However, if you eliminate any blocks which are touching the garbage, the garbage will shatter into normal, run-of-the-mill blocks.  Throughout the game your stack of blocks will slowly grow from below, initially quite slowly but always faster and faster. When the stack reaches the top it will pause and you have seven seconds to save yourself. It is possible, however, to get a momentary repose from your stack's assent. When you eliminate a block or cause garbage to shatter, the growth of your stack will pause. Even if your stack has reached the top and you're about to lose, you will be given a little more time to save yourself. Time during which a block is disappearing or a chunk of garbage is shattering does not count towards your seven seconds.

When playing Liquid War, one has to eat one's opponent. There can be from 2 to 6 players. There are no weapons, the only thing you have to do is to move a cursor in a 2-D battlefield. This cursor is followed by your army, which is composed by a great many little fighters. Fighters are represented by small colored squares. All the fighters who have the same color belong to the same team. One very often controls several thousands fighters at the same time. And when fighters from different teams meet, they eat each other, it is as simple as that.  Note: If the game crashes this might resolve it: Inside liquidwar, go to options->rules->advanced and change Algorithm from "Assembly" to "Standard C" See also the "ASM" option in the port build options.

#: Desktop Files - Each player controls a team of several hedgehogs. During the course of the game, players take turns with one of their hedgehogs. They then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents' hedgehogs, thereby winning the game. Hedgehogs may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the "Rope" or "Parachute", to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving.  A large variety of tools and weapons are available for players during the game: Grenade, Cluster Bomb, Bazooka, UFO, Shotgun, Desert Eagle, Fire Punch, Baseball Bat, Dynamite, Mine, Rope, Pneumatic pick, Parachute. Most weapons, when used, cause explosions that deform the terrain, removing circular chunks. The landscape is an island floating on a body of water, or a restricted cave with water at the bottom. A hedgehog dies when it enters the water (either by falling off the island, or through a hole in the bottom of it), it is thrown off either side of the arena or when its health is reduced, typically from contact with explosions, to zero (the damage dealt to the attacked hedgehog or hedgehogs after a player's or CPU turn is shown only when all movement on the battlefield has ceased).

#: Desktop Files - xpuyopuyo is a UNIX port of a very big time sink :) . Puyo puyo is a puzzle game, somewhat like Tetris, where you strive to match up four "blobs" of the same color. Each match you make gives points, and also dumps gray rocks on the opponent which are irritating and troublesome to get rid of. Multiple matches at a time score more points, and dump more rocks on the opponent (a quintuple-match will dump around 20 rocks on the opponent, all at once).   We ported it overnight to Linux, so we could play whenever we felt like. The AI's evolved more slowly, over the course of a week or so. I welcome sugges- tions on how to make the AI's more difficult during the game currently, they are rather easy to beat on easy level, but more difficult on hard. There are still gaping holes in the game interface which should be fixed soon. Suggestions for improvements are welcome.
